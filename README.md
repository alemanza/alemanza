### Hi, I'm Alejandro 👋🏻
I'm a coding enthusiast passionate about creating efficient and well-designed solutions. I'm deeply interested in **User Experience (UX)** and how an intuitive design can transform the way people interact with technology. I'm also passionate about improving application **performance** to ensure they are fast and smooth.
